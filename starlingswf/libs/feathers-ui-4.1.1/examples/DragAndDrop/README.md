# Feathers Drag and Drop

A very simple of drag and drop in [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/). Includes examples of implementing the `IDragSource` and `IDropTarget` interfaces.

## Requirements

In addition to Starling Framework and Feathers, this example project requires the `MetalWorksDesktopTheme` example theme. You can find the SWC file for this theme at the following location in the Feathers release build:
