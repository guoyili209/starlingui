# Todos Example for Feathers

This [Feathers UI](http://feathersui.com/) example mocks up a simple application to track things that need to get done. The app can add and remove todo items, mark them as completed, and it even supports drag and drop to change the order of items. A custom list item renderer based on the `LayoutGroup` component is used, and it can switch between a normal checkbox and label and an editable mode that adds a drag handle and a delete button.

## Requirements

In addition to Starling Framework and Feathers, this example project requires the `MetalWorksMobileTheme` example theme. You can find the SWC file for this theme at the following location in the Feathers release build:

	themes/MetalWorksMobileTheme/swc/MetalWorksMobileTheme.swc
