# Feathers Components Explorer

A little bit of everything in [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/), presented as a mobile app. Includes screens for each component, with configurable options.

## Requirements

In addition to Starling Framework and Feathers, this example project requires the `MetalWorksMobileTheme` example theme. You can find the SWC file for this theme at the following location in the Feathers release build:

	themes/MetalWorksMobileTheme/swc/MetalWorksMobileTheme.swc
